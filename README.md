# MyShop - README

MyShop is an application I've created using TypeScript and React.js. I personally followed the course by [Fabio Biondi](https://github.com/fabiobiondi), where I learned to utilize technologies such as React.js with TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, React Router, and state management concepts using hooks like useState, useNavigate, useReducer, useEffect. Additionally, I explored the integration of a CMS and an API with Pocketbase, which offers a simple way to create databases suitable for small-scale projects.

## Used Technologies

I've leveraged several modern technologies to build MyShop:

- **React.js con TypeScript**: I've developed interactive user interfaces using the popular React library with enhanced type safety.
- **Tailwind CSS**: I've employed a utility-based CSS framework to simplify styling and responsiveness.
- **React Router**: I've implemented smooth navigation between different sections of the application.
- **Pocketbase**: I've created and managed lightweight CMS and API components, well-suited for small-scale projects.
- **Zustand**: I've utilized Zustand for efficient global state management.
